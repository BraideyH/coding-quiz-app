# Coding Quiz Application

## Description

In this webpage, it was my goal to create a coding quiz to be ran in the browser. I wanted to be sure to include a timer that would count down from 40 seconds after the user has chosen to start the quiz. The user is then prompted with ten coding-centered questions to asnwer before the clock runs out. I included responses to indicate if the user selected the correct answer or incorrect answer. The correct answers are counted and added to the user's final score which is stored locally in the browser. I also implemented and penalty for each incorrect answer- reducing the total available time by five seconds.
